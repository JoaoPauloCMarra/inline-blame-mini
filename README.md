# Inline Blame Mini

A minimal VS Code extension that shows git blame information inline for the current cursor line.

![VS Code Demo](screenshots/vscode-demo.png)

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Only shows blame for the line where your cursor is positioned
- **Clean**: Displays author, time, and commit message inline with subtle styling
- **Smart**: Shows "You" for your own commits and detects Pull Request information
- **Fast**: Optimized with debouncing and caching for better performance

## How it works

When you place your cursor on any line in a git-tracked file, the extension automatically shows:

- Author name (or "You" for your commits)
- Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
- Pull Request title (if detected) or commit message
- Status bar with additional details

Example: ` You, 2 hours ago â€¢ Fix inline blame performance issue`

The extension works automatically - no commands or configuration needed!

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and available in your PATH
- File must be saved and part of a git repository

## Performance

This extension is designed to be fast and efficient:

- Only queries git blame for the current line (not entire files)
- Uses debouncing to prevent excessive git calls
- Caches user information per workspace
- Only updates when moving to different lines

## Styling

The extension uses these default styles (configurable via constants in code):

- Color: `rgba(136, 136, 136, 0.7)` (gray with opacity)
- Font: Italic, 0.9em size
- Margin: 1rem left padding

To customize, edit the constants at the top of `src/extension.js`.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run format      # lint + format
bun run package  # create VSIX
code --install-extension inline-blame-mini-*.vsix
```
